#TODO: For LPGM, they ignore the parameters theta_s (they are assumed to be 0 or unimportant and ignored). Is this a
# correct approach? Can I do this for the other 2 methods too? Change the methods depending on the answer.

#TODO: add a specific variable list to each fit method.
#TODO: different theta_inits in lpgm? DUNNO.
#TODO: use log probability for Gibbs sampling.

# TODO: MAKE SURE THAT THE SEEDS GIVEN TO LPGM FIT ARE DIFFERENT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

#TODO: Test the performance of the TPGM model for different R values.

#TODO: Check what to do with theta st and theta ts not agreeing. Can you do anything?
#TODO: Check what to do with theta ss (node parameters). Include them too after testing?
#TODO: add references to all methods used (towards the end I guess).
